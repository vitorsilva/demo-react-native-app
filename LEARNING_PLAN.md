## How This Learning Plan Works

### Learning Methodology

This project follows a **guided, incremental learning approach**:

**üìù You Write the Code**
- The instructor provides step-by-step guidance
- You write all the code yourself
- No copy-pasting of large code blocks

**üîç Very Small Steps**
- Each concept broken into digestible pieces
- One small change at a time
- Verify each step works before moving on

**üí¨ Questions Encouraged**
- Ask "why" at any point
- Request more detail when needed
- Explore tangential topics that interest you

**üìö Documentation of Learning**
- All questions and explanations captured in `PHASE*_LEARNING_NOTES.md` files
- Creates a personalized reference guide
- Review notes anytime to refresh concepts

### How Each Phase Works

1. **Instructor explains the concept** (brief overview)
2. **Instructor provides code snippet** (small, focused piece)
3. **You add the code to your file**
4. **You confirm when done**
5. **Test together and discuss results**
6. **Ask questions, get detailed explanations**
7. **Move to next small step**

### Example Flow

```
Instructor: "Add these two lines to create state..."
You: [Write the code]
You: "ok"
Instructor: "Great! Now add this button..."
You: [Write the code]
You: "wait, what does useState do again?"
Instructor: [Provides detailed explanation]
You: "ok I understand now, done"
Instructor: "Perfect! Let's test it..."
```

### Your Responsibilities

- ‚úÖ Write the code yourself
- ‚úÖ Let instructor know when each step is complete
- ‚úÖ Ask questions when something is unclear
- ‚úÖ Test each change before moving forward
- ‚úÖ Let instructor know if something doesn't work

### Instructor's Responsibilities

- ‚úÖ Break down tasks into very small steps
- ‚úÖ Provide code in small, manageable pieces
- ‚úÖ Wait for your confirmation before continuing
- ‚úÖ Explain concepts in detail when asked
- ‚úÖ Never write code for you (only guide you)

## Key Concepts & Technologies

### 1. React Native
**What is it?**
React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Instead of building separate apps for iOS and Android, you write once and deploy to both platforms.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Cross-platform**: One codebase for iOS and Android
- **Native components**: Uses real native UI components (not web views)
- **Hot reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use familiar web technologies
- **Large ecosystem**: Thousands of libraries and packages
- **React-based**: Uses React concepts (components, hooks, state)

**React Native vs Web:**
```
Web                    React Native
<div>          ‚Üí      <View>
<span>/<p>     ‚Üí      <Text>
<input>        ‚Üí      <TextInput>
<button>       ‚Üí      <Button> or <Pressable>
CSS            ‚Üí      StyleSheet (inline styles)
```

### 2. Expo
**What is it?**
Expo is a platform and set of tools built around React Native that makes development easier. It provides pre-configured native modules, development tools, and build services.

**Why Use Expo?**
- **No native code setup**: No need for Xcode or Android Studio initially
- **Managed workflow**: Expo handles native configuration
- **Built-in modules**: Camera, location, push notifications, etc.
- **Easy builds**: Cloud-based build service (EAS Build)
- **OTA updates**: Push updates without app store approval
- **Development tools**: Expo Go app for testing

**Expo vs Bare React Native:**
- **Expo**: Easier, faster to start, some limitations
- **Bare**: More control, access to all native code, more setup

### 3. JSX/TSX
**What is it?**
JSX (JavaScript XML) or TSX (TypeScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript/TypeScript files.

**Example:**
```tsx
// This looks like HTML, but it's JavaScript!
const element = (
  <View>
    <Text>Hello World!</Text>
  </View>
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Gets compiled to regular JavaScript
- You can embed JavaScript expressions with `{}`
- Component names must be capitalized
- All tags must be closed (`<View />` or `<View></View>`)

### 4. React Hooks
**What are they?**
Hooks are functions that let you use React features (like state) in functional components.

**Common Hooks:**

#### useState
Manages component state:
```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('initial');
// value: current state
// setValue: function to update state
```

#### useEffect
Runs side effects (data fetching, subscriptions):
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Runs after render
  console.log('Component mounted');
}, []); // Empty array = run once
```

#### useCallback
Memoizes functions:
```tsx
const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Pressed');
}, []);
```

### 5. StyleSheet
**What is it?**
React Native's way of styling components. Similar to CSS but uses JavaScript objects.

**Key Differences from CSS:**
- All properties are camelCase (`backgroundColor`, not `background-color`)
- No units for dimensions (everything is in density-independent pixels)
- Flexbox by default (no `display: flex` needed)
- Limited set of properties compared to CSS

**Example:**
```tsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,              // Fill available space
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,         // No 'px' needed
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

### 6. Flexbox Layout
**What is it?**
The primary layout system in React Native. All containers use flexbox by default.

**Key Properties:**
- `flex`: How much space to take relative to siblings
- `flexDirection`: 'row' or 'column' (default: 'column')
- `justifyContent`: Main axis alignment (vertical by default)
- `alignItems`: Cross axis alignment (horizontal by default)

**Important Difference:**
- **Web**: Default flexDirection is 'row'
- **React Native**: Default flexDirection is 'column'

### 7. EAS (Expo Application Services)
**What is it?**
Cloud-based services for building and submitting React Native apps.

**Key Services:**
- **EAS Build**: Build iOS and Android apps in the cloud
- **EAS Submit**: Submit to app stores
- **EAS Update**: Push over-the-air updates

**Benefits:**
- No need for Mac to build iOS apps
- No need to configure Android Studio
- Consistent build environment
- CI/CD integration

## Phase 2: State Persistence & Data Storage (2-3 hours)

### Goal
Make your app remember data between sessions using local storage.

### Step 2.1: Introduction to AsyncStorage
**What you'll learn**: Persistent storage on mobile

**Key Concepts:**
- AsyncStorage is like localStorage but for React Native
- Asynchronous (requires await)
- Stores key-value pairs as strings
- Data persists between app restarts
- Must serialize/deserialize complex data (JSON)

**Installation:**
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

**Testing:**
- Package installed successfully
- Import works without errors

### Step 2.2: Save Data on Button Press
**What you'll learn**: Writing to persistent storage

**Key Concepts:**
- Use `AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value)`
- Must use `async/await` or `.then()`
- Data must be a string (use `JSON.stringify()` if needed)
- Error handling with try/catch

**Implementation:**
```tsx
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const saveData = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('savedText', inputValue);
    setDisplayText(inputValue);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving data:', error);
  }
};
```

**Testing:**
- Type text and press button
- Check console for errors
- Close and reopen app (data should persist)

### Step 2.3: Load Data on App Start
**What you'll learn**: Reading from persistent storage, useEffect hook

**Key Concepts:**
- `useEffect` runs after component mounts
- Load data when app starts
- `AsyncStorage.getItem(key)` returns a Promise
- Handle null values (no data saved yet)

**Implementation:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  loadSavedData();
}, []); // Empty dependency array = run once

const loadSavedData = async () => {
  try {
    const savedText = await AsyncStorage.getItem('savedText');
    if (savedText !== null) {
      setDisplayText(savedText);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading data:', error);
  }
};
```

**Testing:**
- Save some text
- Close app completely
- Reopen app
- Saved text should appear automatically

### Step 2.4: Add Clear Functionality
**What you'll learn**: Deleting stored data

**Key Concepts:**
- `AsyncStorage.removeItem(key)` deletes data
- Clear both state and storage
- Provide user feedback

**Implementation:**
Add a "Clear" button that:
- Clears `displayText` state
- Removes item from AsyncStorage
- Provides visual feedback

**Testing:**
- Save data
- Press clear button
- Verify data is cleared
- Restart app, data should not reappear

## Best Practices

1. **State Management**
   - Use useState for local component state
   - Consider Context API for global state
   - Use useReducer for complex state logic

2. **Performance**
   - Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
   - Avoid inline functions in render
   - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` when appropriate
   - Optimize FlatList with `windowSize` and `maxToRenderPerBatch`

3. **Code Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Extract reusable components
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

4. **Styling**
   - Define styles outside component (at bottom)
   - Use `StyleSheet.create()` for performance
   - Consider theme/constants for colors
   - Test on different screen sizes

5. **Data Persistence**
   - Always handle AsyncStorage errors
   - Validate data before saving
   - Consider data migration strategy
   - Clear old/unused data

6. **Security**
   - Never store sensitive data in AsyncStorage (use Secure Store)
   - Validate user input
   - Use HTTPS for API calls
   - Keep dependencies updated

7. **Testing**
   - Test on real devices (not just emulators)
