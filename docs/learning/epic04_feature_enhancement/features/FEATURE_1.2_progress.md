# Feature 1.2: New! Badge - Progress Log

## Task 1: Capture BEFORE Screenshot (2026-01-24)

**Status:** Done

**What was done:**
- Created `screenshots/` directory for feature documentation
- Created `BEFORE_SCREENSHOT_README.md` documenting the current state using Option B (ASCII wireframe reference)
- Documented the current suggestion card layout from `app/suggestions/[mealType].tsx`
- Noted that suggestion cards currently show:
  - Background image with gradient overlay
  - Ingredient combination text
  - Accept button and favorite toggle
  - No "New!" badge (to be added)

**Approach taken:**
- Used Option B from the feature spec (ASCII wireframe as "before" reference) since automated screenshot capture requires running the app
- Documented current implementation structure for reference

**Verification:**
- Ran linting: passed (0 errors, 5 warnings - pre-existing)
- Ran unit tests: 238 passed, 0 failed
