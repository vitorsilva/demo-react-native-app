# Epic 4: Feature Enhancement

**Status:** 🔄 SCOPE BEING REFINED

## 🎯 What This Epic Is About

**Expanding SaborSpin with User-Requested Features**

Epic 3 established the production-ready foundation. Epic 4 focuses on enhancing the app with features that add real value to users based on feedback and real-world usage.

> **Note:** The exact scope of this epic is still being refined. The phases below represent potential directions, not a finalized plan.

## 🗺️ Phase Overview

### Phase 6: Validation & Iteration (3-4 weeks, ongoing)
**Goal:** Deploy to real users and iterate based on feedback

**⚠️ Moved from Epic 3** - This phase validates the production-ready app with real users.

Tasks:
- Distribute APK to 5-10 beta testers
- Monitor usage via telemetry
- Collect user feedback
- Fix bugs based on real usage
- Iterate through multiple versions (V1.0.0 → V1.1.0 → V1.2.0)
- Reflect on entire learning journey

**Why this matters:** Real user validation transforms the app from "technically complete" to "user-validated product."

**You'll learn:**
- Beta testing for mobile apps
- APK distribution
- User feedback collection
- Telemetry analysis with real data
- Iterative development
- Data-driven decision making
