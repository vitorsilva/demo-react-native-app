## Task 3: Add preparation_methods table + seed

**Date:** 2026-01-25

### Implementation Summary
- Added migration version 5 to `lib/database/migrations.ts`
- Created `preparation_methods` table with columns: `id`, `name`, `is_predefined`, `created_at`
- Seeded 12 predefined preparation methods: fried, grilled, roasted, boiled, baked, raw, steamed, sautéed, stewed, smoked, poached, braised

### Notes
- Migration follows existing pattern using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- Uses `recordExists` helper to prevent duplicate seeding
- All 309 unit tests pass after implementation
- TypeScript check passes with no errors
- ESLint shows only pre-existing warnings (unrelated to this change)

### No Issues Encountered
- Implementation was straightforward following the established migration pattern
- No special handling required
