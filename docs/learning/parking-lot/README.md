# Parking Lot

This folder contains phases and features that were documented but not implemented. These are kept for future reference and potential implementation in later versions.

## 📦 Parked Items

### Epic 2: Meals Randomizer

**[Phase 6: Future Enhancements](./EPIC02_PHASE6_FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md)**
- **Status:** Not Implemented
- **Reason:** Moved to Epic 3 Phase 4 (optional polish feature)
- **Content:** Enhancement ideas for V2 (favorites, analytics, photos, nutrition, etc.)
- **Decision:** Will implement one feature during Epic 3 Phase 4 based on real usage

## 📝 Purpose of This Folder

The parking lot serves to:
1. **Archive documented work** - Keep planning documents even if not implemented
2. **Prevent loss of ideas** - Good ideas aren't deleted, just deferred
3. **Maintain context** - Show what was considered and why it wasn't done
4. **Enable future work** - Easy reference when ready to implement

## 🔄 How Items Get Here

Items are moved to the parking lot when:
- A phase is planned but skipped in favor of different priorities
- Features are documented but deferred to future versions
- Ideas are explored but not immediately actionable
- Work is superseded by alternative approaches

Items are **NOT** deleted because:
- They represent valuable planning work
- They may be implemented later
- They provide context for decision-making
- They show the evolution of the project

## 🚀 How Items Leave the Parking Lot

Items are moved out when:
1. Implemented in a later epic/phase
2. Incorporated into new planning documents
3. No longer relevant (can be deleted with explanation)

**Process:**
- Update this README with status
- Keep original document for reference
- Link to new implementation location
