# Getting Started with SaborSpin

Welcome to SaborSpin! This guide will help you get started with the app.

## What is SaborSpin?

SaborSpin helps you decide what to eat without repeating meals too often. Get personalized meal suggestions based on your ingredients and eating history.

**The Problem:** Decision fatigue around daily meals. Eating the same things repeatedly.

**The Solution:** Variety-enforced meal suggestions that prevent repetition while respecting your preferences.

## First Launch

When you first open SaborSpin, you'll see the home screen with:
- **Meal type buttons** (Breakfast, Snack by default)
- **Your recent meals** (empty at first)

## Your First Meal Suggestion

1. **Tap a meal type** - Choose "Breakfast" or "Snack"
2. **View suggestions** - You'll see 4 meal combinations
3. **Pick one** - Tap the meal you want
4. **Confirm** - The meal is logged to your history

That's it! SaborSpin will remember what you ate and avoid suggesting similar ingredients for a few days.

## Understanding Variety Enforcement

SaborSpin uses a "cooldown" system:
- Each meal type has a cooldown period (default: 3 days)
- Ingredients you ate recently won't appear in suggestions
- This ensures variety in your meals

**Example:** If you had eggs for breakfast on Monday, you won't see eggs in breakfast suggestions until Thursday.

## Home Screen

The home screen shows:
- **Meal type buttons** at the top - tap to get suggestions
- **Recent meals** below - your eating history

## Suggestions Screen

When you tap a meal type, you'll see:
- **4 meal suggestions** - each is a combination of ingredients
- **Generate New Ideas button** - get fresh suggestions
- **Back button** - return to home

Tap any suggestion to log it as your meal.

## Viewing History

Your recent meals appear on the home screen, showing:
- What you ate
- When you ate it (Today, Yesterday, 2 days ago, etc.)
