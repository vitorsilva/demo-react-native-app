## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with categories** - Create categories before adding many ingredients
2. **Be specific** - "Greek Yogurt" is better than just "Yogurt"
3. **Use cooldowns wisely** - 3 days works for most people; adjust if needed
4. **Keep ingredients active** - Only disable, don't delete, in case you want them later
