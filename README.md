# Demo React Native App

A learning-focused React Native mobile application built with Expo, progressing through structured epics from fundamentals to real-world features.

## 📚 Learning Journey

This project follows a guided, incremental learning approach where concepts are broken into digestible pieces and you write all the code yourself.

### ✅ Epic 1: Infrastructure & Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Status:** 100% Complete ✅ | **Completed:** 2025-10-28

Built professional development infrastructure and learned React Native fundamentals.

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ React Native basics (components, state, styling)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure (Jest, React Native Testing Library)
- ✅ Code quality automation (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Full observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus)
- ✅ Structured logging with trace correlation
- ✅ Error tracking (Sentry)
- ✅ Professional development workflow

**Documentation:** [docs/epic01_infrastructure/](./docs/epic01_infrastructure/)

### 🔄 Epic 2: Meals Randomizer (IN PROGRESS)

**Status:** ~15% Complete | **Started:** 2025-01-04

Building a real mobile app that generates variety-enforced meal suggestions to eliminate decision fatigue.

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Data Foundation & SQLite (95% complete)
  - Database layer with TypeScript types
  - Ingredient and meal log CRUD operations
  - 14 unit tests (all passing)
  - Seed data with 22 Portuguese ingredients
- ⏳ Phase 2: State Management & Core Logic (Not started)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Building the UI (Not started)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Navigation & User Flow (Not started)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Polish & Testing (Not started)
